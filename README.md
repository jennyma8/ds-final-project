Project: Pedestrian detection model
a little blabla...
Even before the pandemic, the popularity of online retailing was destroying shopping malls and stores in general. Research showed that 96% of the decline in shopping mall revenue was due to Amazon alone. The pandemic has made those challenges even harder for retailers.

I believe that Data Science can play a little helper role in analyzing the customer traffic and stores can understand more about the factors that can impact the customer experience with a regression analysis.
